## Optimization: Combinatorial Optimization Problems

Search for the best of many possible combinations. This includes some classical problems
such as the [TSP](#TSP). Examples of problems include:

- Package scheduling; e.g. how to ship packages on trucks to arrive sooner to a 
final destination
- Find the most efficient route for a travelling salesman to take when he has the
constrain of visiting N particular cities.
