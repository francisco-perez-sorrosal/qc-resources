# Overview

_“Sometimes it happens that a man's circle of horizon becomes smaller and smaller, and as the radius approaches zero it 
concentrates on one point. And then that becomes his point of view.”_

_― David Hilbert_

**Quantum Computing**: Paradigm that explicitly using the properties of Quantum Mechanics, allows to perform 
numerical computations orders of magnitude faster than currently available non-quantum computers.
