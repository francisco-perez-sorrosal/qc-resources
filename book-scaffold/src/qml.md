# Quantum Machine Learning

As its name states, that's a research/application topic that interconnects ideas/projects from QC and ML.
This connection QC/ML can work both ways: QC <-> ML

1. QC -> ML: QC can help by speeding up the time taken in the typical ML pipeline of training/evaluating/inferencing a/on a model.
2. ML -> QC: ML can help on solving current problems/difficulties in the QC realm of research such as develop/explore 
new Quantum-based algorithms, solve noise/ECC (error-correcting codes) problems in current Quantum HW etc.

## Libraries

- [Quiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-machine-learning/machine-learning-qiskit-pytorch.html)

- [Pennylane (XanaduAI)](https://pennylane.ai/) [Github](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) A cross-platform Python library 
for differentiable programming of QC. Works with Pytorch and TF.
