# Qubit

A unitary vector in a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space.

## Quantum De-coherence

The mathematical representation of a quantum system is given by a wave function. If there's a definite phase
relation between different states of the system, the system is said to be coherent. In a perfectly isolated
environment, coherence is maintained indefinitely. However, the quantum system is impossible to be maniputated.
For example, during measurement, the system isolation is broken, so coherence is shared with the environment and it's
 lost as time passes. This process is called decoherence.

## Reversible Computation

## Noise (Nash embeddings)

Information is a probabilistic phenomenon; the smaller the probability of an event, the more information it conveys. 
Noise affects the probability of an event.

In 2020, noise is still a problem in QC. But was solved in the previous technologies as well.

### Noise in Quantum Systems
* Any phenomena that affects the quantum source of the probability of an event.

### Noise sources

1. Physical processes that diminishes quantum-ness:
    * Heat
    * Classical entity (computer) sending instructions to a QC
    * Quantum measurement
        - De-coherence is a form of noise
  
2. Mathematically noise arises from:
    * Topology (shape)
    * Differentiable structures
    * Geometry (metrics/distances)


[Wigners' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_theorem) quantum dynamics in ComplexP(n-1) are still linear and algebraic

### Enter the quantum realm (from euclidean)
  * Apply unitary operation on the observable states then you enter in q space
  * Quantum entanglement
  * The trick is to enter the quantum realm coherently (error free). The countiuous and smooth preservation of
   fundamental math features gives a finessed set of programming tools:
    - Assembly language
    - Firmware
    - Middleware
    - Operating System

### How do we exit (reading output)
  * Quantum measurement distorts the picture (does not preserve geometry)
  * [Whitney's Embedding Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem)
  * [Nash's Embedding Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_embedding_theorem) -> No noise in the system
  * Use Nash embedding as a robust benchmark


### Manifold
* Manifold structure
* Manifold learning
* Quantum manifold learning
